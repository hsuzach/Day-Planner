The goal of this assignment was to a daily log of tasks for each hour.

The application displays the current date with the use of moment.js.

Tasks can be written into the timeblocks and logged into local storage with the save button.

The time blocks will also dynamically update by color to show if an hour has already past, is the current hour, or is a future hour to come.
